# MeatLens - Terms and Conditions (Field Use Version)

These field-use terms should be read with the [project overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md),
[security guide](SECURITY.md), and [user manual](manual-content.md). The
technical architecture and route behavior are documented separately in
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [API reference](API_REFERENCE.md).

**Effective Date:** May 1, 2026

## 1. Purpose of the System

MeatLens is an AI-assisted inspection tool designed to help meat inspectors, market authorities, and vendors identify potential indicators of meat spoilage and poor handling conditions.

The system supports on-site inspection workflows, including wet market and field environments.

## 2. Scope and Limitations

MeatLens is a decision-support tool, not a diagnostic or certification authority. Its scope and limitations are as follows:

**Product Scope**
* MeatLens is trained and validated specifically for **pork** freshness classification. It is not designed or validated for other meat types (e.g., beef, poultry, seafood), and results on non-pork samples should not be relied upon.
* The system is intended for use within the context of wet market and field inspection settings, consistent with the Ikot-Palengke Program of Olongapo wet markets.

**Functional Scope**
* MeatLens performs image-based classification only. It does not perform microbiological, chemical, or laboratory-grade testing, and cannot detect contamination, pathogens, or chemical adulteration that is not visually apparent.
* The system assesses meat freshness only and produces advisory classifications of Fresh, Not Fresh, or Spoiled. It does not assess sickness, illness, pathogens, contamination, or other health conditions, and does not issue certifications, official findings, or regulatory rulings.

**Technical Limitations**
* Classification accuracy depends on training data coverage and may not generalize to all pork cuts, breeds, handling conditions, or spoilage presentations, particularly those underrepresented in the training dataset.
* Model performance is affected by image quality, lighting conditions, camera hardware, angle, and occlusion. Degraded input conditions may reduce accuracy.
* Recommended device baseline: Android 12 or iOS 22, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a camera of at least 50 MP. These are recommendations, not requirements; MeatLens may still work on lower-spec devices, but image quality, processing speed, and accuracy may vary.
* As with any AI classification model, MeatLens is subject to a non-zero rate of false positives and false negatives and should not be treated as infallible.
* The system's underlying model and thresholds are calibrated against publicly available and peer-reviewed food science references. Where region-specific or agency-issued freshness standards exist, users should defer to those official standards where applicable.

**Out-of-Scope Use**
* MeatLens is not intended for use as a standalone basis for enforcement actions, penalties, confiscation, or public health rulings.
* MeatLens is not intended for use outside meat inspection support (e.g., general food safety auditing, unrelated product categories, or non-inspection commercial purposes).
* The system is not a substitute for licensed veterinary, food safety, or regulatory authority judgment.

## 3. Role of the User (Inspector Responsibility)

MeatLens is a support tool only. All users, especially licensed inspectors, acknowledge that:

* Final decisions must be based on professional judgment.
* The system does not replace official inspection protocols.
* Users must follow existing guidelines from relevant authorities (for example LGU regulations and institutional policies).

## 4. Proper Use in Field Conditions

To ensure reliable results, users must:

* Capture clear images under adequate lighting.
* Avoid using heavily obstructed or contaminated samples.
* Use the system as part of a broader inspection process, not as a standalone test.

Improper usage may result in inaccurate outputs.

## 5. AI Output Limitations

Users acknowledge that:

* Results are advisory in nature and limited to Fresh, Not Fresh, or Spoiled classifications.
* The system does not assess sickness, illness, pathogens, contamination, or other health conditions.
* The system may produce false positives or false negatives.
* Environmental conditions affect accuracy, including lighting, camera quality, and storage conditions.

MeatLens provides risk indicators, not definitive rulings.

## 6. Enforcement and Decision-Making

Any enforcement action (for example confiscation, penalties, or reporting violations):

* Must be carried out by authorized personnel.
* Must follow official procedures and documentation standards.
* Must not rely solely on MeatLens results.

## 7. Data Handling

When using the system:

* Captured images may be stored for inspection records and system improvement.
* Data may be reviewed for audit, research, or model refinement purposes.
* Sensitive or identifiable data must be handled in accordance with the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012.

## 8. Offline Use

MeatLens may function without internet access. In such cases:

* Some features may be limited.
* Data may be stored locally and synced later.
* Users are responsible for ensuring proper data handling on their device.

## 9. Misuse of the System

Users must not:

* Use the system to falsify inspection results.
* Intentionally manipulate inputs to produce misleading outputs.
* Use the system outside its intended purpose (meat inspection support).

## 10. Liability Disclaimer

The developers of MeatLens are not responsible for:

* Incorrect inspection outcomes resulting from misuse.
* Decisions made solely based on system output.
* Damages, losses, or regulatory actions arising from improper reliance.

Use of the system is at the user's discretion and responsibility.

## 11. Updates and Improvements

The system may be updated periodically to improve detection accuracy, expand scenarios, and fix issues.
Users are encouraged to use the latest available version.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.

## 13. Acknowledgment

By using MeatLens, you confirm that:

* You understand it is an AI-assisted tool, not a final authority.
* You will apply professional inspection standards at all times.
* You accept full responsibility for decisions made during inspections.

**MeatLens: Supporting inspectors, not replacing them.**
