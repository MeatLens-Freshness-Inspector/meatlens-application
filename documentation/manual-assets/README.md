# MeatLens manual image assets

The assets support the [user manual](../manual-content.md) and reflect the
current [architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md). Use [Getting started](../GETTING_STARTED.md)
and [Deployment](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for the application/runtime context that
the screenshots and diagrams represent.

These assets support the official `MeatLens User Manual.docx`.

The mobile captures cover authentication, the inspector pre-scan and capture flow, history, messaging, profile password change, administrator navigation/reporting, and developer tabs/API Docs. The numbered overlays are instructional annotations; the underlying screens are sanitized test-session states. No production credentials, tokens, access codes, personal information, or IP addresses are present in these assets.
