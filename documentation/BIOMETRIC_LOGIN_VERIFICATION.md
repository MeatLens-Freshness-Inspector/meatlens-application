# Biometric login verification record

This record complements the [biometric login guide](BIOMETRIC_LOGIN.md). See
[Security](SECURITY.md) for session trust boundaries and [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md)
for local/native verification prerequisites.

Verification date: 2026-09-09

## Fresh checks

- Native/auth/profile unit coverage: **35 passed, 0 failed**
- Auth-provider/offline regression coverage: **7 passed, 0 failed**
- Frontend typecheck: **passed**
- Changed-frontend ESLint scope: **0 errors, 1 existing Fast Refresh warning**
- Frontend production build: **passed** (`vite 5.4.21`, built in 50.12s)
- WebAuthn/passkey journey: **2 passed, 0 failed**
- Documentation validation: **passed**

The full repository typecheck remains blocked by an unrelated syntax error already present in the user-modified `backend/src/modules/developer/infrastructure/DeveloperDashboardStorageService.ts` at line 41. That file was not changed by the biometric work.

Native biometric prompts still require device-level verification on an Android or iOS device/simulator with a configured credential and enrolled biometric. Browser E2E intentionally verifies that native biometric controls are absent while the existing WebAuthn flow remains available.
