# Deployment guide

Use [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) for local prerequisites and
environment names, [Security](SECURITY.md) for trust boundaries, and [API
reference](API_REFERENCE.md) for health and smoke-check endpoints.

MeatLens is deployed as two application services backed by Supabase:

- Frontend: Netlify static hosting.
- Backend: Render Node web service.
- Database/Auth/Storage: Supabase managed project.

No Redis, Grafana, queue worker, or separate metrics service is required.

## Recommended order

1. Create the Netlify site and record its production/preview origins.
2. Create the Render backend and configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with those origins.
3. Set Netlify’s `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the Render `/api` URL.
4. Apply Supabase migrations and storage policies before exercising protected flows.

## Netlify frontend

The root `netlify.toml` uses `frontend/` as the base directory, runs `npm run build`, publishes `frontend/dist`, and rewrites SPA routes to `index.html`.

Configure:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-render-service.onrender.com/api
```

The frontend build synchronizes and validates the MobileNetV3 ONNX artifact and metadata. A missing model or API base URL fails the preflight instead of producing a partial deployment.

## Render backend

`render.yaml` creates one Node web service with:

- build: `npm ci && npm run build`
- start: `npm run start`
- health check: `GET /api/analysis/health`
- upload staging: `/tmp/meatlens-uploads`

Configure these server-only values in Render:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-or-anon-key
APP_SESSION_SECRET=<long-random-secret>
CSRF_TOKEN_SECRET=<different-long-random-secret>
TRANSPORT_KEY_ID=v1
TRANSPORT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY=<escaped-newline-encoded-rsa-private-key>
AUDIT_LOG_KEY=<64-hex-characters-or-base64-for-32-bytes>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-site.netlify.app,https://*--your-site.netlify.app,https://localhost
APP_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/meatlens-uploads
```

Generate the transport key once and keep the private key only in the backend
secret store. The browser receives the matching public key from
`GET /api/transport/public-key`; it never receives `TRANSPORT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`
or a reusable AES key.

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:3072 -out transport-private.pem
```

When a hosting dashboard does not preserve multiline values, replace each PEM
line break with the two characters `\n` before saving the value as
`TRANSPORT_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY`. Do not add any `VITE_TRANSPORT_*` variable to the
frontend environment.

Optional values:

```env
APP_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS=28800
CSRF_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=900
SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900
SESSION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS=900
APP_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=meatlens_session
DEVELOPER_OPTIONS_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
DEVELOPER_OPTIONS_TOKEN_SECRET=<token-secret>
DEVELOPER_OPTIONS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=21600
SMTP_USER=<smtp-user>
SMTP_PASS=<smtp-app-password>
```

Do not expose the service key, session secrets, audit key, SMTP password, or developer password to Netlify or browser code.

Session cleanup accepts a minimum interval of 300 seconds and is intentionally independent from the idle timeout. A longer cleanup interval delays only physical row deletion; authenticated requests still reject an idle session immediately.

## Supabase release checklist

- Apply all migrations in `backend/supabase/migrations/` in lexical/timestamp order.
- Confirm RLS and storage policies are active.
- Confirm the query-support and bounded-chat migrations are present.
- Create/verify the inspection-image and developer artifact storage buckets.
- Validate Auth redirect URLs and the production frontend origin.

## Smoke checks

```bash
curl -i https://your-render-service.onrender.com/api/analysis/health
```

Then verify sign-in, cookie session bootstrap, a CSRF-protected mutation, an image upload, and one role-protected admin/developer route. Browser clients must use the credentialed cookie transport; native clients may use bearer tokens.

## CI and previews

The repository workflow is path-aware and keeps deployment independent of paid infrastructure. Every relevant change receives:

- least-privilege read-only checkout permissions;
- cancellation of superseded runs on the same branch or pull request;
- documentation validation, including required guides and local-link checks;
- backend unit, integration, architecture, contract, typecheck, and build gates;
- frontend unit, component, integration, and critical Playwright gates; and
- a final quality-gate job that summarizes all lanes and fails on any failure or cancellation.

Documentation-only changes run the documentation validator and skip the expensive application lanes. Scheduled and manual runs additionally execute infrastructure checks and the full Playwright suite. Keep preview deploy hooks optional; deployment does not depend on them.

## Free-tier request budget

Do not configure GitHub Actions, cron-job.org, UptimeRobot, or another hosted monitor to ping the production Render service inside its idle window. `render.yaml` keeps Render's native `/api/analysis/health` readiness check, but repository-controlled traffic must allow a free web service to spin down. A legitimate request may therefore experience a normal Render cold start.

While the backend is running, tracked-session cleanup starts once and then issues one combined Supabase delete every 900 seconds (96 scheduled requests per day at most). It makes no requests while Render is spun down.

Messages use one authenticated browser event stream only while the Messages screen is visible and online. The backend lazily shares one Supabase Realtime channel across active stream clients and removes it after the final client leaves. Opening, selecting, focusing, reconnecting, sending, and manual refresh may issue bounded REST requests; no interval polling or REST fallback is used.

For the implemented service boundary and route composition, see
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md). For the repository’s required CI quality
gates, see the CI section of the root [README](../README.md).
