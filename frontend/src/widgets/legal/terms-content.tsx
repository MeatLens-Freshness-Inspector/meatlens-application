        <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold">1. Purpose of the System</h3>
        <p>
          MeatLens is an AI-assisted inspection tool designed to help meat inspectors, market authorities, and
          vendors identify potential indicators of meat spoilage and poor handling conditions.
        </p>
        <p>The system supports on-site inspection workflows, including wet market and field environments.</p>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold">2. Scope and Limitations</h3>
        <p>MeatLens is a decision-support tool, not a diagnostic or certification authority. Its scope and limitations are as follows:</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Product Scope</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            MeatLens is trained and validated specifically for <strong>pork</strong> freshness classification. It is not
            designed or validated for other meat types (e.g., beef, poultry, seafood), and results on non-pork samples
            should not be relied upon.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system is intended for use within the context of wet market and field inspection settings, consistent
            with the Ikot-Palengke Program of Olongapo wet markets.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Functional Scope</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            MeatLens performs image-based classification only. It does not perform microbiological, chemical, or
            laboratory-grade testing, and cannot detect contamination, pathogens, or chemical adulteration that is not
            visually apparent.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system assesses meat freshness only and classifies samples as <strong>Fresh, Not Fresh, or Spoiled</strong>.
            It does not detect or diagnose sick meat, disease, illness, pathogens, contamination, parasites, chemical
            adulteration, or other health conditions. Freshness indicators do not establish that meat is safe, fit for
            consumption, or free from hazards, and the system does not issue certifications, official findings, or
            regulatory rulings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Technical Limitations</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            Classification accuracy depends on training data coverage and may not generalize to all pork cuts, breeds,
            handling conditions, or spoilage presentations, particularly those underrepresented in the training
            dataset.
          </li>
          <li>
            Model performance is affected by image quality, lighting conditions, camera hardware, angle, and occlusion.
            Degraded input conditions may reduce accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            As with any AI classification model, MeatLens is subject to a non-zero rate of false positives and false
            negatives and should not be treated as infallible.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system&apos;s underlying model and thresholds are calibrated against publicly available and peer-reviewed
            food science references. Where region-specific or agency-issued freshness standards exist, users should
            defer to those official standards where applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Recommended Device Specifications</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Recommended baseline: Android 12 or iOS 22, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a camera of at least 50 MP.</li>
          <li>These specifications are recommendations, not requirements. MeatLens may still work on lower-spec devices, but image quality, processing speed, and accuracy may vary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Out-of-Scope Use</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>MeatLens is not intended for use as a standalone basis for enforcement actions, penalties, confiscation, or public health rulings.</li>
          <li>
            MeatLens is not intended for use outside meat inspection support (e.g., general food safety auditing,
            unrelated product categories, or non-inspection commercial purposes).
          </li>
          <li>The system is not a substitute for licensed veterinary, food safety, or regulatory authority judgment.</li>
